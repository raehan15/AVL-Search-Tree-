# AVL-Search-Tree

Embark on a captivating journey through the realm of data structures with my C++ project, an intricate exploration of an AVL Search Tree implementation. This codebase is a testament to the elegance and efficiency of self-balancing binary search trees, tailored to manage a vast collection of words extracted from multiple documents. The heart of this project lies in its adept use of the AVL tree structure, ensuring optimal balance and performance in search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Delving into the code, you'll find a meticulous construction of the AVLSearchTree class, complete with nodes storing keys and values, and various essential methods for maintaining tree balance. These include rotations (right and left) and utility functions for node height and balance factor calculations. The tree dynamically adjusts to maintain its balance as new elements are inserted or removed, showcasing the power of AVL trees in handling unbalanced data.

A key feature of this project is its practical application in processing and analyzing text data. The program reads from input files, filters and normalizes the data, and stores each word in the AVL tree, tracking their frequency across different documents. This approach not only demonstrates the versatility of AVL trees but also offers insights into text analysis and frequency distribution.

The user interface of the program is intuitive, allowing for easy input of document names and queries. The search functionality is adept at handling complex queries, returning results in a clear and concise manner. Additionally, the program supports the removal of words from the tree, showcasing the dynamic nature of AVL trees in adapting to changes.

In essence, this project is more than a demonstration of a data structure. It's a blend of algorithmic efficiency and practical utility, offering a deep dive into how AVL trees can be leveraged to manage and analyze data efficiently. It stands as a reflection of my ability to implement complex structures and solve real-world problems through code, a journey where data meets algorithmic elegance.
